## Independent Project - Javascript - Week Four

#### By **Kristen McKee, July 21, 2017**

### Description

This app is a site where users can add geocaches they've hidden to a list. This app uses Google's Geocoding API to convert physical addresses to latitude and longitude, and to convert latitude and longitude coordinates to physical addresses.

(Geocaching is an outdoor activity in which participants either hide or locate objects in obscure places. The location of these objects are stored on various listing sites as GPS coordinates.)

### Specs
* Users can add new hidden geocaches to the site list, by physical location or GPS coordinates. They can also add themselves as creators of the geocaches they add.
* Users can view all geocaches added to the site.
* Users can click on a geocache from the list and see the physical location, the GPS coordinates, and the creator.

### Setup/Installation Requirements
* Open CMD/Terminal
* git clone `https://github.com/kristendynamite/geocacher.git`
* Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
